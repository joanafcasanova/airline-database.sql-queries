# Airline Database Project

## Overview
The Airline Database project is designed to manage and analyze data related to airline operations. It includes various SQL queries, a defined schema, and sample data to facilitate testing and development.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:

- **queries/airplanes_queries.sql**: Contains SQL queries related to the airline database, including information about airplanes, passengers, routes, and ticket sales.
  
- **schema/airline_schema.sql**: Defines the schema for the airline database, including SQL statements to create tables, define relationships, and set constraints.

- **data/sample_data.sql**: Provides SQL statements to insert sample data into the airline database for testing and development purposes.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Database Creation**: Use the `schema/airline_schema.sql` file to create the necessary tables and relationships in your database.

2. **Insert Sample Data**: Run the `data/sample_data.sql` file to populate the database with sample records.

3. **Running Queries**: Use the `queries/airplanes_queries.sql` file to execute various SQL queries and retrieve information from the database.

## Usage
- Ensure you have a compatible SQL database system installed.
- Follow the setup instructions to create the database and insert sample data.
- Modify and run the queries as needed to analyze airline data.
